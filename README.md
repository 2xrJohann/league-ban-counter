# league-ban-counter
riot team said in a vid they are comfortable with the game balance, this counts up all the banned characters in my last 50 games and prints them for me, some characters get banned >20 times i dont think the game is very balanced 


if you want to run it you have to put your api key in and your ign, both somewhere in main function
