# league-ban-counter
Riot released the new pre season video and one of the employees (possibly threatened to say this since its so sadly untrue) reckoned that they are happy with the state of the game and its balance, especially new characters and how they have been claimed to have power creep and new items etc, awfully strange when I yoink the riot api data and download my last 50 lobbies some characters have been banned over 20 times. Must be some sort of community gag lol the bronze players over at the balance reckon its all good
